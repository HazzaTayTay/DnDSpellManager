You thrust forth a beam of psychic energy into the mind of one creature within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 psychic damage, and has disadvantage on attacks against you for the duration. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and suffers none of the spell's other effects.
At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the psychic damage increases by 1d6 for each slot above 2nd
